# streaming-site-clone (discontinued)
- Simple streaming site clone. Everything here are still on structuring phase or half-baked. It was my very first time trying out JS through React, so I had to use appwrite to handle a little backend. I just got curious about how API handling is done and how it functions, for this I used API of TMDB. Also wanted to understand a bit of backend interaction. And ig those were already sufficient as a welcoming entry-point.
