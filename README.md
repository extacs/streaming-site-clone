# streaming-site-clone
- Simple streaming site clone, but instead its a collection of shows (movies/series) based off my current watch list. It was my very first time trying out JS through React, so I had to use appwrite to handle a little backend. I got curious about how API handling is done and how it functions and wanting to learn small backend interaction with a small DB.
